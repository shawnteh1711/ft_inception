# Components of Docker
1. Docker Engine
Docer Egine is the base engine installed on your host machine to build and run containers using Docker components and services. It uses a client-server architecture. 

2. Docker Client and Server
Docker Client is accessed from terminal and a Docker Host runs the Docker Daemon and Registry
Docker Client and Server communicate through REST Api.

3. Docker Images
Docker Image is a template with instructions, which is used for creating Docker Containers. Docker File creates a Docker Image using the build command

4. Docker Containers
Docker Container is a standalone executable software package which includes application and their dependencies. Using Docker Image, any user can run the code in order to create Docker Containers.

5. Docker Registry

Once a Docker Image is built, it's uploaded in a registry or a Docker Hub.
